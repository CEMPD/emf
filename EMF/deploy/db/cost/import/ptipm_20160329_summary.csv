Application:  Natural gas reburning (NGR) involves add-on controls to reduce NOx emissions.  NGR is a combustion control technology in which part of the main fuel heat input is diverted to locations above the main burners, called the reburn zone.  As flue gas passes through the reburn zone, a portion of the NOx formed in the main combustion zone is reduced by hydrocarbon radicals and converted to molecular nitrogen (N2).

This control applies to bituminous/subbituminous coal-fired electricity generation sources, including sources with atmospheric fluidized bed combustion.

Discussion: In a reburn boiler, fuel is injected into the upper furnace region to convert the NOx formed in the primary combustion zone to molecular N2 and H2O.  In general, the overall process occurs within three zones of the boiler; the combustion zone, the gas reburning zone, and the burnout zone (ERG, 2000).  In the combustion zone the amount of fuel is reduced and the burners may be operated at the lowest excess air level.  In the gas reburning zone the fuel not used in the combustion zone is injected to create a fuel-rich region where radicals can react with NOx to form molecular Nitrogen.  In the burnout zone a separate overfire air system redirects air from the primary combustion zone to ensure complete combustion of unreacted fuel leaving the reburning zone.  

Operational parameters that affect the performance of reburn include reburn zone stoichiometry, residence time in the reburn zone, reburn fuel carrier gas and temperature and O2 levels in the burnout zone (ERG, 2000)."

Application:  This control is the use of selective catalytic reduction add-on controls to tangentially coal-fired utility boilers for the reduction of NOx emissions.  SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  with a  nitrogen based reducing  reagent, such as ammonia or urea, to reduce the NOx into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O).  The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

This control applies to bituminous/subbituminous coal-fired electricity generation sources, including sources with atmospheric fluidized bed combustion with nameplate capacity greater than 100 MW.

Discussion: Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems are among the post-combustion NOx control systems that can be effective in controlling  mercury.   This is based on recent pilot-scale tests that  indicate that SNCR and SCR systems may enhance Hg capture under some conditions by oxidizing Hg0 (Massachusetts, 2002).

Researches are investigating the possibility of Hg0 to Hg2+ conversion in SCR systems as a possible result of ammonia on fly ash mercury reactions.  In the SCR process, a catalyst (such as vanadium, titanium, platinum, or zeolite) is used in a bed reactor, and the NOx reduction occurs at the surface of the catalyst bed with the help of a reducing agent (diluted ammonia or urea, which generates ammonia in the process).  The ammonia mixture is injected into the flue gas upstream of the metal catalyst bed reactor, which is located upstream of a PM or SO2 control device (usually between the economizer outlet and air heater inlet, where temperatures range from 230 to 400oC). 

Recent pilot-scale tests indicate that SCR systems can enhance Hg capture under some conditions by oxidizing Hg0.  On the plant-size scale, only one set of tests have been performed to measure the effectiveness of SCR systems.  Application of SCR system, combined with spray dryer absorber was tested at a plant which was firing bituminous coal.  The test results indicated greater than 95 percent mercury removal for the combined co-control systems (Massachusetts, 2002)."

This control applies to bituminous/subbituminous coal-fired electricity generation sources, including sources with atmospheric fluidized bed combustion with nameplate capacity greater than 100 MW.

Discussion: Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems are among the post-combustion NOx control systems that can be effective in controlling  mercury.   This is based on recent pilot-scale tests that  indicate that SNCR and SCR systems may enhance Hg capture under some conditions by oxidizing Hg0 (Massachusetts, 2002).

Researches are investigating the possibility of Hg0 to Hg2+ conversion in SCR systems as a possible result of ammonia on fly ash mercury reactions.  In the SCR process, a catalyst (such as vanadium, titanium, platinum, or zeolite) is used in a bed reactor, and the NOx reduction occurs at the surface of the catalyst bed with the help of a reducing agent (diluted ammonia or urea, which generates ammonia in the process).  The ammonia mixture is injected into the flue gas upstream of the metal catalyst bed reactor, which is located upstream of a PM or SO2 control device (usually between the economizer outlet and air heater inlet, where temperatures range from 230 to 400oC). 

Recent pilot-scale tests indicate that SCR systems can enhance Hg capture under some conditions by oxidizing Hg0.  On the plant-size scale, only one set of tests have been performed to measure the effectiveness of SCR systems.  Application of SCR system, combined with spray dryer absorber was tested at a plant which was firing bituminous coal.  The test results indicated greater than 95 percent mercury removal for the combined co-control systems (Massachusetts, 2002)."

Application:  This control is the use of selective catalytic reduction add-on controls to coal/wall fired utility boilers for the reduction of NOx emissions.  SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  with a  nitrogen based reducing  reagent, such as ammonia or urea, to reduce the NOx into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O).

This control applies to pulverized-dry bottom coal-fired electricity generation sources with a nameplate capacity greater than 100 MW.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

Application:  This control is the use of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to reduce PM emissions.  An ESP uses electrical forces to move particles in an exhaust stream onto collector plates. Electrodes in the center of the flow are maintained at high voltage and generate an electrical field forcing particles to the collector walls. In dry ESPs, the collectors are knocked by various mechanical means to dislodge the particulate, which slides downward into a hopper. 

This control applies to electricity generation sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: In the wire-plate ESP, the gas flows around vertical, metal plates.  The electrodes are long, weighted wires hanging between the plates.  The voltage applied to the electrodes causes the gas between the electrodes to break down, known as a ""corona."" The electrodes are most often given a negative polarity because a negative corona supports a higher voltage than a positive corona.

Certain types of losses affect control efficiency. The dislodging of the accumulated layer also projects some of the particles back into the gas stream. Another factor in the performance of ESPs is the resistivity of the collected material.  Dusts with high resistivities are also not well-suited for collection in dry ESPs. These particles are not easily charged nor easily collected.

The particulate-bound form of mercury can be readily captured in the particulate matter (PM) control devices, e.g., fabric filters (FF). Also, gaseous mercury (both Hg0 and Hg 2+) can potentially be adsorbed on fly ash and subsequently be collected on a PM device.  However, the level of this adsorption depends on the speciation of mercury, the flue gas concentration of fly ash, and many other factors."

Electrodes in the center of the flow are maintained at high voltage and generate an electrical field forcing particles to the collector walls. In dry ESPs, the collectors are knocked by various mechanical means to dislodge the particulate, which slides downward into a hopper. 

This control applies to electricity generation sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: In the wire-plate ESP, the gas flows around vertical, metal plates.  The electrodes are long, weighted wires hanging between the plates.  The voltage applied to the electrodes causes the gas between the electrodes to break down, known as a ""corona."" The electrodes are most often given a negative polarity because a negative corona supports a higher voltage than a positive corona.

Certain types of losses affect control efficiency. The dislodging of the accumulated layer also projects some of the particles back into the gas stream. Another factor in the performance of ESPs is the resistivity of the collected material.  Dusts with high resistivities are also not well-suited for collection in dry ESPs. These particles are not easily charged nor easily collected.

The particulate-bound form of mercury can be readily captured in the particulate matter (PM) control devices, e.g., fabric filters (FF). Also, gaseous mercury (both Hg0 and Hg 2+) can potentially be adsorbed on fly ash and subsequently be collected on a PM device.  However, the level of this adsorption depends on the speciation of mercury, the flue gas concentration of fly ash, and many other factors."

Application:  This control is the addition of a mechanical shaker type fabric filter to reduce PM emissions from utility boiler waste streams.  In a fabric filter, flue gas is passed through a tightly woven or felted fabric, collecting PM by sieving and other mechanisms.  The gas stream is drawn from beneath a cell plate in the floor and into the filter bags.  The gas proceeds from the inside to the outside of the filter bags. The particles collect on the inside of the bags, forming a filter cake. In mechanical shaking units, the tops of bags are attached to a shaker bar, moved briskly to clean the bags.

This control applies to electricity generation sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: In a fabric filter, flue gas is passed through a tightly woven or felted fabric, collecting PM by sieving and other mechanisms. Fabric filters may be in the form of sheets, cartridges, or bags, with many individual filter units together in a group. Bags are the most common type of filter. The dust cake that forms on the filter from the collected PM can significantly increase collection efficiency. (EPA, 2000)

Mechanical shaking is a popular cleaning method because it is both simple and effective. In typical operation, dusty gas enters an inlet pipe to the fabric filter and very large particles are removed using a baffle plate fall into the hopper. The gas stream is drawn from beneath a cell plate in the floor and into the filter bags (EPA, 2000). The gas proceeds from the inside to the outside of the filter bags. The particles collect on the inside of the bags, forming a filter cake. In mechanical shaking units, the tops of bags are attached to a shaker bar, moved briskly (usually in a horizontal direction) to clean the bags. The shaker bars are operated by mechanical motors or by hand (EPA, 1998).

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators.  Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).  Fabric filters may be good candidates for collecting fly ash from low-sulfur coals or containing high unburned carbon levels and are relatively difficult to collect with electrostatic precipitators.

Pulse-jet cleaning of fabric filters is a relatively new type of fabric filter, as they have only been used for the past 30 years. This cleaning mechanism has grown in popularity because it can treat high dust loadings, operate at constant pressure drop, and occupy less space than other types of fabric filters (EPA, 2000).  Particulate-laden gas flows into the bag. The gas flows from the outside to the inside of the bags, and then out the gas exhaust. The particles collected on the outside drop into a hopper below the fabric filter (EPA, 1998).

During pulse-jet cleaning, a short burst of high pressure air is injected into the bags (EPA, 1998).  The pulse is blown through a venturi nozzle at the top of the bags and establishes a shock wave that continues onto the bottom of the bag. The wave flexes the fabric dislodging the dust cake.

There are several unique attributes of pulse-jet cleaning. The cleaning pulse is very brief allowing the flow of dusty gas to continue during cleaning. The bags not being cleaned continue to filter, taking on extra duty from the bags being cleaned (EPA, 2000).  Pulse-jet cleaning is more intense and occurs with greater frequency than the other fabric filter cleaning methods. The cleaning dislodges nearly all of the dust cake each time the bag is pulsed.  Pulse-jet filters, as a result, do not rely on a dust cake to provide filtration.  Felted (non-woven) fabrics are used in these types of filters because they do not require a dust cake.

Since bags cleaned by the pulse-jet method do not need to be isolated for cleaning, pulsejet cleaned fabric filters do not need extra compartments to maintain adequate filtration during cleaning. Also, because of the intense and frequent nature of the cleaning, they can treat higher gas flow rates with higher dust loadings. Consequently, fabric filters cleaned by the pulse-jet method can be smaller than other filters in the treatment of the same amount of gas and dust, making higher gas-to-cloth ratios achievable (EPA, 1998).

Reverse-air cleaning is a popular filter cleaning method as it has been used extensively and improved over the years. It is a gentler but sometimes less effective clearing mechanism than mechanical shaking.  Reverse-air cleaning is performed by forcing clean air through the filters in the opposite direction of the dusty gas flow. The change in direction of the gas flow causes the bag to flex and crack the filter cake allowing for internal cake collection (EPA, 2000).

The most common design is to have separate compartments within the fabric filter so that each can be isolated and cleaned separately while the others continue to treat the dusty gas.  There are several methods of reversing the flow through the filters.  One method of providing the reverse flow is by the use of a fan or cleaned gas from other compartments. Reverse-air cleaning only used alone in cases where the dust releases easily from the fabric. In many instances, reverse-air is used along with shaking, pulsing or sonic horns (EPA, 1998).

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators.  Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).  Fabric filters may be good candidates for collecting fly ash from low-sulfur coals or containing high unburned carbon levels and are relatively difficult to collect with electrostatic precipitators.

Application:  Coal washing (or coal cleaning) is a pre-combustion process that improves the quality of coal by removing impurities and increasing its heat content, thus reducing SO2 emissions.  Coal washing can also be effective in removing mercury (Hg) from the coal and the utility plants emissions.

This control is applicable to electricity generating sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: Coal contains noncombustible minerals and mineral oxides that are collectively referred to as ash.  Coal washing is a pre-combustion process which is used to remove ash and sulfur from the coal.  Coal washing can separate minerals from coal through the difference in specific gravities of the constituents or by surface-based floatation.  Two types of coal washing methods can be performed on intermediate and coarse coal:

1.  Gravity concentration method:  Technologies that use this method include jigs, cyclones, shaking tables and Reichert cones.  
2.  Dense medium separation method:  This process usually takes place in large open tanks, with the pulverized magnetite (Fe3O4) in water used as the preferred medium for separation.

Fine coal cleaning involves chemical conditioning of the coal followed by flotation to recover clean coal.  Depending on the characteristics of the coal, some mines may perform fine coal conditioning using lime, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid.  Conditioning is used to adjust pH, to facilitate the flotation process (EPA, 2000)."

Application:  This control is based on the addition of wet scrubber type flue gas desulfurization add-on controls to reduce SO2 emissions.  In wet systems, a liquid sorbent is sprayed into the flue gas in an absorber vessel, removing PM from the gas flow.  Limestone and lime-based sorbents are most frequently used in scrubbers in the United States (Pechan, 1997).

This control is applicable to electricity generating sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: In wet systems, a liquid sorbent is sprayed into the flue gas in an absorber vessel.  Limestone and lime-based reagents are most frequently used in scrubbers in the United States (EPA, 2002).

Studies have shown that Wet FGD can also be effective in controlling mercury emissions.  The ionic mercury compounds in coal flue gases are water-soluble and can be captured by WFGD scrubbers.  In Wet FGD, the soluble gaseous Hg is mixed with the water-based scrubbing liquid and then removed from the flue stream with the disposed scrubbing solution.  Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization scrubbers use a caustic slurry, typically water and limestone or water and lime as SO2 scrubbing solutions.

A PM control device always precedes a wet FGD scrubber.  Four types of PM control devices are commonly used upstream of the Wet FGD systems: FFs, CS-ESPs, HS-ESPs, and PM scrubbers (PS).  In systems with a FF upstream of the Wet FGD system, an increase in mercury reduction is observed across the Wet FGD system due to the oxidization of elemental mercury that occurs on the fabric filter cake.  Units equipped with FF+WFGD achieve the highest Hg reduction followed by units with CS-ESP, HS-ESP, and PS.  Units with HS-ESPs operate at temperatures where the oxidization and capture of Hg is limited; therefore, a lower mercury reduction across the system is achieved (Massachusetts, 2002). 

Mercury control efficiencies of existing post-combustion controls used for coal-fired electric utility boilers were examined based on a series of tests that were conducted as part of a research and development study by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory for EPA (EPA, 2002b).  Table 3 shows the overall mercury control efficiencies for the SO2 co-controls.  Note: the control efficiencies are provided for a combined unit operations (WFGD plus a PM control device)."

Application:  In terms of fuel composition, sulfur content is a major factor in determining the potential SO2 emissions levels.  SO2 emissions can be reduced by switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal.   However, the emission reduction levels will depend on the types of coal that are being switched (DOE, 1997).

This control is applicable to electricity generating sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: Coal contains noncombustible minerals and mineral oxides that are collectively referred to as ash.  In terms of fuel composition, ash content of fuel is the major factor in determining total suspended particle emissions (TSP).  The higher the ash content, the higher the amount of TSP emitted from combustion.  Fuel substitution can impact TSP emissions leading to their reduction.  It should be noted that if the new coal has a significantly lower energy content there may be an increase in TSP emissions due to the higher amounts of coal needed to achieve the same energy output (DOE, 1994).

While effective in lowering SO2 and PM emissions, the practice of switching to a low-sulfur content can lead to reduced collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators which are the most common method of particulate controls for utility boilers.  Lowering the flue gas sulfur content increases the fly ash resistivity and subsequently lowers the overall particulate matter collection efficiency at these post-combustion units.   Lower particle collection efficiency in coal fired boilers leads to a lower mercury removal efficiency.  Therefore this form of fuel switching, from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal, is not a viable option for controlling mercury and will not be discussed in detail."
