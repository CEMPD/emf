In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 76% (Pechan, 2001).

The following equations, based primarily on information in the Air Pollution Cost Manual (EPA, 2002), are used for large NOx sources as defined above:

The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1993).

A discount rate of 10 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 50%  (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components: The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Table 6-4 and Ch. 6 of the Process Heaters ACT.  The breakdown was obtained using the O&M costs for a mechanical draft process heater fired on distillate oil and having a capacity of 69 MMBTU per hour.  The cost percentage is applied to heaters fired on LPG via technology transfer (Pechan, 1998).  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Small source = less than 1 ton NOx per ozone season day

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1994).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned along with a capital to annual costs ratio of 5.9.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 10 years (EPA, 1994).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Appendix E of ICI boiler ACT document (see pages E-27 and E-28).  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.  The model boiler size used to develop cost estimates is 45 MMBtu/hr.

Small source = 40 to 174 MMBtu/hr

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1993).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned along with a capital to annual costs ratio of 6.5.  A discount rate of 10 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 48%  (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components: The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Table 6-4 and Ch. 6 of the Process Heaters ACT.  The breakdown was obtained using the O&M costs for a mechanical draft process heater having a capacity of 69 MMBTU per hour.  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1993).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned along with a capital to annual costs ratio of 6.5.  A discount rate of 10 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 48%  (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components: The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Table 6-4 and Ch. 6 of the Process Heaters ACT.  The breakdown was obtained using the O&M costs for a mechanical draft process heater fired on distillate oil and having a capacity of 69 MMBTU per hour.  The cost percentage is applied to heaters fired on LPG via technology transfer (Pechan, 1998).  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Small source = 40 to 174 MMBtu/hr

Efficiencies for stationary source NOx control were updated for a 2020 base year based on analysis performed by the EPA for the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Proposed Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ground-Level Ozone (EPA, 2007).  The costs were calculated by assuming that default cost scales linearly by efficiency from the LNB+FGR costs.  This cost in 1990$ was then converted to 1999$ by applying a growth factor of 1.235 (Sorrels, 2007).

O&M Cost Components: The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Table 6-3 and Ch. 6 of the ACT for Process Heaters.  The breakdown was obtained using the O&M costs for a mechanical draft process heater having a capacity of 77 MMBTU per hour fired on natural gas.  The cost percentage is applied to heaters fired on process gas via technology transfer (Pechan, 1998).  A capacity factor of 0.5 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Small source = less than 1 ton NOx per ozone season day

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1994).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned along with a capital to annual costs ratio of 2.0. A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 20 years (EPA, 1994).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the economic analysis for a 200 megawatt unit provided in Appendix E:  Cost Analysis of Reburning Systems for conventional gas reburn.  The example calculation with a $1.00 per million Btu difference between the primary fuel cost and the reburn fuel cost was used.  The reference for this information is the 1998 Andover Technology Partners report for NESCAUM/MARAMA.  The fuel cost differential is the dominant operating cost of NGR.

Small source = less than 1 ton NOx per ozone season day

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  The basis of the costs are model plant data  in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1994).  The model boiler size used to develop cost estimates is 45 MMBtu/hr. From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned along with a capital to annual costs ratio of 2.9. A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 10 years (EPA, 1994). The 7 percent discount rate used as a baseline in AirControlNET is changed from the 10 percent rate used in the ACT document.

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Appendix E of the ACT document.  (See pages E-3 and E-4.)  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values and a capital to annual cost ratio of 7.0 are assigned.

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the Chapter 4 costing algorithms in EPA, 2001.  The fixed O&M cost is the sum of the annual maintenance material and labor cost, and is estimated to be 0.66 percent of the capital cost.  This portion of the O&M cost is included in the database as maintenance labor.  The NH3 use cost equation is used to estimate chemicals costs.  The annual replacement cost equation is used to estimate replacement materials costs.  The energy requirement cost equation is used to estimate electricity costs.

Electricity cost = $0.03/kW-hr

Large source = emission levels greater than 1 ton per ozone season day

Where information was available in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1994), capacity-based equations are used to calculate costs.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 20 years (EPA, 1994).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

The following equations, based primarily on information in the Air Pollution Cost Manual (EPA, 2002), are used for large NOx sources as defined above: 

From Uncontrolled:

Capital Cost = 82,400.9 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.65
Annual Cost = 5,555.6 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.7885

From RACT Baseline:

Capital Cost = 79,002.2 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.65
Annual Cost = 8,701.5 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.6493

Note:  All costs are in 1990 dollars.

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the Chapter 4 costing algorithms in EPA, 2001.  The fixed O&M cost is the sum of the annual maintenance material and labor cost, and is estimated to be 0.66 percent of the capital cost.  This portion of the O&M cost is included in the database as maintenance labor.  The NH3 use cost equation is used to estimate chemicals costs.  The annual replacement cost equation is used to estimate replacement materials costs.  The energy requirement cost equation is used to estimate electricity costs.

Electricity cost = $0.03/kW-hr
Ammonia cost = $225/ton

The above O&M component costs are in 2000 dollars.  The model plant size used to estimate ICI boiler O&M cost components is 400 MMBtu/hr."

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values and a capital to annual cost ratio of 7.1 are assigned.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 20 years (EPA, 1994).

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

(Sorrels, 2008)  Therefore, in order to not underestimate cost, the highest costs associated with applying this control to utility boilers was used.
This is a potential over-estimate of the control cost."
"NSNCRECBSW","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The cost equations used in this analysis are based on cost equations from EPA's IPM (EPA, 1998).  In the IPM, model plants applying SNCR had capacities of 100 MW.  The equations were scaled to develop costs for smaller or larger boilers than the model plant.  The cost equations also assume a high NOx rate (>=0.5 pounds per MMBtu) and a capacity utilization factor of 65% were assumed for the utility boilers, as well as a 7% discount rate and 20-year lifetime of the controls.

Capital Costs (CC): 

Nameplate Capacity:  netdc [=] MW
Total Capital Costs:  TCC = $15.80 per kW
Scaling Factor:  SF = (sfn / netdc)^sfe = (100 / MW )^0.681

CC (for netdc < 500)  = TCC  * netdc * 1000 * SF
CC (for netdc > 500) = TCC  * netdc * 1000 

Operating & Maintenance (O&M):

Fixed O&M:  omf = $0.24 per kW per year
Variable O&M:  omv = $0.73 mills per kW-hr
Capacity Factor:  capfac = 0.65

O&M = ( omf * netdc * 1000) + ( omv * netdc * 1000 * capfac * 8760 / 1000)

Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife
Interest Rate = I
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ I ( 1 + I ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + I )^ Equiplife) - 1] 

Total Cost = (CRF * CC) + O&M

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in the OAQPS Control Cost Manual-Section 4-NOx Controls.  The example problem in subsection 1.5 is used as an example for computing typical capital and annual costs of a retrofit SNCR system being applied to a 1,000 MMBtu/hour wall-fired, industrial boiler firing sub-bituminous coal.  In this analysis, the SNCR system is assumed to operate for 5 months of the year with a capacity factor of 65 percent, resulting in a total capacity factor of 27 percent.  The total variable direct annual cost is the sum of the cost of the reagent, electricity, water, coal, and ash.  Indirect annual costs are zero.

Electricity Cost:  $0.05 $/kW-hr
Coal Cost:  $1.60/MMBtu

Note:  All costs are in 1990 dollars."

Large source = emission levels greater than 1 ton per ozone season day

Where information was available in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1994), capacity-based equations are used to calculate costs.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 20 years (EPA, 1994).

In general, incremental cost equations (or defaults cost) are used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 70% (Pechan, 2001).

The following equations, based primarily on information in the Air Pollution Cost Manual (EPA, 2002), are used for large NOx sources as defined above: 

From Uncontrolled:

Capital Cost = 110,487.6 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.423
Annual Cost = 3,440.9 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.7337

From RACT Baseline:

Capital Cost = 67,093.8 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.423
Annual Cost = 7,514.2 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.4195

Note:  All costs are in 1990 dollars.

Small source = emission levels less than 1 ton per ozone season day

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned for small sources.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies greater than 26% and less than or equal to 55% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components: The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the detailed information in Table 6-4 and Ch. 6 of the Process Heaters ACT.  The breakdown was obtained using the O&M costs for a mechanical draft process heater fired on residual fuel oil and having a capacity of 69 MMBTU per hour.  The cost percentage is applied to heaters fired on other fuel via technology transfer (Pechan, 1998).  A capacity factor of 0.58 is used in estimating the O&M cost breakdown.

Small source = 3.3 MW to 34.4 MW

The basis of the costs are model plant data contained in the Alternative Control Techniques (ACT) document (EPA, 1993).  Capital and annual cost information was obtained  from control-specific cost data based on tons of glass produced.  O&M costs were back calculated from annual costs.   From these determinations, default cost per ton values were assigned along with a capital to annual cost ratio of 3.7 (Pechan, 1998).  A discount rate of 10 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment lifetime of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 76% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the information for an example small turbine in Table 6-5 of the ACT document for stationary gas turbines.  The model plant is a 26.8 megawatt MS5001P turbine.  Continuous operation 8,000 hours per year is used to estimate operating costs.

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan, 2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $15 to $50 per scfm
Typical value is $27 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $40 per scfm
Typical value is $16 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 200 and 500 thousand acfm and 1 million acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price       0.067         $/kW-hr
Dust disposal           25            $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan, 2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $15 to $50 per scfm
Typical value is $27 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $40 per scfm
Typical value is $16 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 200 and 500 thousand acfm and 1 million acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price          0.067     $/kW-hr
Dust disposal             25         $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan, 2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $15 to $50 per scfm
Typical value is $27 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $40 per scfm
Typical value is $16 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 200 and 500 thousand acfm and 1 million acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price      0.067       $/kW-hr
Dust disposal         25           $/ton disposed

Note:  All costs are in 1995 dollars."

"PDESPMPCR","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The costs for ESPs of conventional design under typical operating conditions are developed using EPA cost estimating spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan, 2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $15 to $50 per scfm
Typical value is $27 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $40 per scfm
Typical value is $16 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 200 and 500 thousand acfm and 1 million acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price         0.067       $/kW-hr
Dust disposal             25          $/ton disposed

Note:  All costs are in 1995 dollars."

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan, 2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $15 to $50 per scfm
Typical value is $27 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $40 per scfm
Typical value is $16 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 200 and 500 thousand acfm and 1 million acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price        0.067     $/kW-hr
Dust disposal            25        $/ton disposed

"PFFMSMICC","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The costs for mechanical shaker cleaned systems are generated using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a). When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000)..  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $8 to $71 per scfm
Typical value is $29 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $24 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types.  Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).      The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price           0.0671          $/kW-hr
Compressed air           0.25             $/1000 scf
Dust disposal              25                $/ton disposed

O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types.  Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).      The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price         0.0671         $/kW-hr
Compressed air          0.25           $/1000 scf
Dust disposal             25              $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1990).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $8 to $71 per scfm
Typical value is $29 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $24 per scfm

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $8 to $71 per scfm
Typical value is $29 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $24 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types.  Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).      The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price          0.0671       $/kW-hr
Compressed air           0.25         $/1000 scf
Dust disposal               25           $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $8 to $71 per scfm
Typical value is $29 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $24 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types.  Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).      The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price            0.0671       $/kW-hr
Compressed air             0.25         $/1000 scf
Dust disposal                25            $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $6 to $26 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $5 to $24 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types.  Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).    The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price           0.0671       $/kW-hr
Compressed air           0.25          $/1000 scf
Dust disposal               25            $/ton disposed

Note:  All costs are in 1998 dollars."

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $6 to $26 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $5 to $24 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component.

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $9 to $84 per scfm
Typical value is $34 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $27 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price        0.0671        $/kW-hr
Compressed air        0.25           $/1000 scf
Dust disposal             25            $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $9 to $84 per scfm
Typical value is $34 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $27 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price         0.0671      $/kW-hr
Compressed air         0.25         $/1000 scf
Dust disposal              25          $/ton disposed

Range from $6 to $27 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price          0.0671       $/kW-hr
Compressed air           0.25         $/1000 scf
Dust disposal              25            $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $9 to $84 per scfm
Typical value is $34 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $27 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price       0.0671        $/kW-hr
Compressed air        0.25          $/1000 scf
Dust disposal            25            $/ton disposed

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.  

Capital Costs:

Range from $9 to $84 per scfm
Typical value is $34 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $27 per scfm
Typical value is $13 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average bag cost was estimated using the costs for standard bag types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of bags was included in the O&M cost of the bags using a bag life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price            0.0671    $/kW-hr
Compressed air            0.25       $/1000 scf
Dust disposal                25         $/ton disposed

Costs are primarily driven by the waste stream volumetric flow rate and pollutant loading.  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $7 to $13 per scfm
Typical value is $9 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $9 to $25 per scfm
Typical value is $14 per scfm

Costs are primarily driven by the waste stream volumetric flow rate and pollutant loading.  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $7 to $13 per scfm
Typical value is $9 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $9 to $25 per scfm
Typical value is $14 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 25, 75 and 150 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 4.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An average cartridge cost was estimated using the costs for standard cartridge types. Capital recovery for the periodic replacement of cartridges was included in the O&M cost of the cartridges using a cartridge life of 2 years (EPA, 1998a).   The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price     0.0671       $/kW-hr
Compressed air      0.25         $/1000 scf
Dust disposal          25           $/ton disposed

"PVESCIBOL","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The following are cost ranges for venturi wet scrubbers, developed using EPA cost-estimating spreadsheets (EPA, 1996) and referenced to the volumetric flow rate of the waste stream treated.  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (10 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $3 to $28 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $119 per scfm
Typical value is $42 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for Impingement Plate Scrubbers (EPA, 1996).  O&M costs were calculated for two model plants with flow rates of 2,000 and 150,000 acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. The model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 3.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8760 hours per year.  An inlet water flow rate for the scrubber was assumed to be 9.4 lbs/min. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price          0.067    $/kW-hr
Process water price    0.20      $/1000 gal
Dust disposal             25        $/ton disposed
Wastewater treatment 3.8       $/ thousand gal treated

Note:  All costs are in 1995 dollars."

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1999).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (10 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $3 to $28 per scfm
Typical value is $11 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $4 to $119 per scfm
Typical value is $42 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for Impingement Plate Scrubbers (EPA, 1996).

Capital and operating costs are generally higher due to noncorrosive materials requirements, increased water usage, and treatment and disposal of wet effluent.  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1990).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $30 to $60 per scfm
Typical value is $40 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $45 per scfm
Typical value is $19 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1999).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 10, 15 and 20 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  A water flow rate for the ESP was assumed to be 5 gal/min per thousand acfm. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price                0.067  $/kW-hr
Process water price          0.20   $/1000 gal
Dust disposal                   20      $/ton disposed
Wastewater treatment      1.5     $/ thousand gal treated

"PWESPMPIS","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The following are cost ranges for wire-plate ESPs, developed using EPA cost-estimating  spreadsheets for dry wire-plate ESPs with adjustments made to reflect wet wire-plate ESPs (EPA, 1999).  Capital and operating costs are generally higher due to noncorrosive materials requirements, increased water usage, and treatment and disposal of wet effluent.  When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 1990).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

Capital Costs:

Range from $30 to $60 per scfm
Typical value is $40 per scfm

O&M Costs:

Range from $6 to $45 per scfm
Typical value is $19 per scfm

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1999).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 10, 15 and 20 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  A water flow rate for the ESP was assumed to be 5 gal/min per thousand acfm. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price           0.067    $/kW-hr
Process water price     0.20     $/1000 gal
Dust disposal              20        $/ton disposed
Wastewater treatment  1.5      $/ thousand gal treated

Note:  All costs are in 1995 dollars."

O&M Cost Components: The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for ESP (EPA, 1999).  O&M costs were calculated for three model plants with flow rates of 10, 15 and 20 thousand acfm. The average percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. All the model plants were assumed to have a dust loading of 6.0 grains per cubic feet. The operating time was assumed to be 8640 hours per year.  A water flow rate for the ESP was assumed to be 5 gal/min per thousand acfm. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Electricity price                0.067    $/kW-hr
Process water price          0.20     $/1000 gal
Dust disposal                   20        $/ton disposed
Wastewater treatment       1.5      $/ thousand gal treated

Note:  All costs are in 1995 dollars."

DEF = de-escalation factor (to convert to 1990 dollars) = 0.9383
RF = retrofit factor = 1.1

For stack flowrate less than 1,0280,000 cu. ft./min = (1,0280,000/Flowrate)^0.6)*93.3*RF*Flowrate* DEF

For stack flowrate greater than or equal to 1,0280,000 cu. ft./min = 93.3*RF*Flowrate*DEF

Operating and Maintenance (O&M) cost = 3.35+0.000729*8736*DEF * Flowrate

Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife = 15 years
Interest Rate = I = 7%
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ i ( 1 + i ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + i )^ Equiplife) - 1

Annual cost = (Capital cost * CRF) + O&M cost

O&M Cost Components:  The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using a modified version of EPAGÇÖs CUE Cost program (EPA, 2000). O&M costs were calculated for a model plant with a flowrate of 800,000 acfm. The percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. A credit for the sale of by-product was subtracted from the disposal costs.  A capacity factor of 65% was assumed  The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Calcium Carbonate                  15         $/ton
Dibasic acid                           430        $/ton
Disposal by gypsum stacking     6        $/ton
Disposal by landfill                   30        $/ton
Credit for by-product                 2         $/ton
Steam                                  3.5         $/1000 lb
Electrical energy                    25         mills/kWh

The cost effectiveness is determined by dividing the annual cost by the annual tons SO2 reduced."

Cost equations for dual absorption:

Capital cost = $990,000 + $9.836 * Flowrate

Operating cost = $75,800 + $12.82 * Flowrate

Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife = 15 years
Interest Rate = I = 7%
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ i ( 1 + i ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + i )^ Equiplife) - 1

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost components for dual absorbtion are based on two model plants with sulfur intake of 750 tons per day and 1,500 tons per day (EPA, 1985).  There are no disposal costs and a credit for the recovered product. Annual operating days are assumed to be 350 days. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Water                         0.30          $/cubic meter
Steam                       10.50         $/gJ

Cost equations for dual absorption:

Capital cost = $990,000 + $9.836 * Flowrate

Operating cost = $75,800 + $12.82 * Flowrate

Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife = 15 years
Interest Rate = I = 7%
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ i ( 1 + i ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + i )^ Equiplife) - 1

Annual cost = (Capital cost * CRF) + O&M cost

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost components for dual absorbtion are based on two model plants with sulfur intake of 750 tons per day and 1,500 tons per day (EPA, 1985).  There are no disposal costs and a credit for the recovered product. Annual operating days are assumed to be 350 days. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Water                      0.30          $/cubic meter
Steam                    10.50         $/gJ
