In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 76% (Pechan, 2001).

The following equations, based primarily on information in the Air Pollution Cost Manual (EPA, 2002), are used for large NOx sources as defined above: 

From Uncontrolled:

Capital Cost = 71,281.1 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.505
Annual Cost = 7,826.3 * Capacity (MMBtu/hr)^0.505

From RACT Baseline:
