Small source = emission levels less than 1 ton per ozone season day

Costs for stationary source NOx control are based on an analysis of EPA's NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call (Pechan, 1998).  From this analysis, default cost per ton values are assigned.  A discount rate of 7 percent and a capacity factor of 65 percent are assumed, along with an equipment life of 15 years (EPA, 1993).

In general, the incremental default cost is used for sources where there are existing controls (RACT baseline), with efficiencies less than or equal to 76% (Pechan, 2001).

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the information for an example small turbine in Table 6-9 of the ACT document for stationary gas turbines.  The model plant is a 26.8 megawatt MS5001P turbine.  Continuous operation 8,000 hours per year is used to estimate operating costs.
