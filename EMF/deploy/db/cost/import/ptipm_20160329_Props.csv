In the IPM, model plants applying SCR had capacities of 200 MW.  The equations were scaled to develop costs for smaller or larger boilers than the model plant.  The cost equations also assume a high NOx rate (>=0.5 pounds per MMBtu) and a capacity utilization factor of 65% were assumed for the utility boilers, as well as a 7% discount rate and 20-year lifetime of the controls.

The fixed O&M cost is the sum of the annual maintenance material and labor cost, and is estimated to be 0.66 percent of the capital cost.  This portion of the O&M cost is included in the database as maintenance labor.  The NH3 use cost equation is used to estimate chemicals costs.  The annual replacement cost equation is used to estimate replacement materials costs.  The energy requirement cost equation is used to estimate electricity costs.

The above O&M component costs are in 2000 dollars.  The model plant size used to estimate utility boiler O&M cost components is 750 MMBtu/hour.

O&M = ( omf * netdc * 1000) + ( omv * netdc * 1000 * capfac * 8760 / 1000)

O&M Cost Components:  The O&M cost breakdown is estimated using the economic analysis for a 200 megawatt unit provided in Appendix E:  Cost Analysis of Reburning Systems for conventional gas reburn.  The example calculation with a $1.00 per million Btu difference between the primary fuel cost and the reburn fuel cost was used.  The reference for this information is the 1998 Andover Technology Partners report for NESCAUM/MARAMA.  The fuel cost differential is the dominant operating cost of NGR.

Coal Cost:  $1.50/MMBtu
Natural Gas Cost:  $2.50/MMBtu
Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife
Interest Rate = i
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ i ( 1 + i ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + i )^ Equiplife) - 1] 

Total Cost = (CRF * CC) + O&M

Note:  All costs are in 1990 dollars."

Disposal of the liquid wastes formed during these processes can be difficult and/or expensive and are reflected in the operating and maintenance costs (ERG, 2000).

The cost of coal washing can vary significantly based on characteristics of the raw coal and the types of processes involved, as well as the plant capacity.  The capital costs for coal washing facilities range form $12 to $16 per ton of coal.  Operating costs range from $3.17 to $4.40 per ton for systems that feature high BTU recovery, high levels of ash rejection (40-50%) and 20 to 50% sulfur removal (SIU, 1997)."

O&M Cost Components:  With the retrofit of combustion controls, the boiler unburned carbon may increase. This increase results in a reduction in boiler efficiency, requiring more coal to be burned to maintain the boiler output.  As the coal firing rate increases, there are corresponding increases in the solid waste generation and auxiliary power usage. The O&M costs were evaluated for tangential-fired boilers only.  With no changes in the capital cost for wall-fired boilers, the fixed O&M costs, generally taken as a function of the capital cost, are not expected to vary. Also, no changes in the variable O&M costs are expected, since unburned carbon assumptions are unchanged.  

For tangential-fired boilers, the general maintenance cost was conservatively taken as 1.5 percent of the total project cost for each technology.  Also, a plant capacity factor of 85 percent was assumed.     

Coal Cost:  $1.20/MMBtu
Solid waste disposal: $12/ton
Auxiliary power: 25 mills/KWh


Note: O&M cost components are in 1999 dollars, all others are in $2004."

O&M Cost Components:  With the retrofit of combustion controls, the boiler unburned carbon may increase. This increase results in a reduction in boiler efficiency, requiring more coal to be burned to maintain the boiler output.  As the coal firing rate increases, there are corresponding increases in the solid waste generation and auxiliary power usage. The O&M costs were evaluated for tangential-fired boilers only.  With no changes in the capital cost for wall-fired boilers, the fixed O&M costs, generally taken as a function of the capital cost, are not expected to vary. Also, no changes in the variable O&M costs are expected, since unburned carbon assumptions are unchanged.  

For tangential-fired boilers, the general maintenance cost was conservatively taken as 1.5 percent of the total project cost for each technology.  Also, a plant capacity factor of 85 percent was assumed.     

Coal Cost:  $1.20/MMBtu

"PFFPJUBC","COST_BASIS","No category","","text","COST_BASIS","The costs for pulse-jet cleaned systems are generated using EPAGÇÖs cost-estimating spreadsheet for fabric filters (EPA, 1998a).

When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000). Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.

Total Cost = (CRF * CC) + O&M

O&M Cost Components:  With the retrofit of combustion controls, the boiler unburned carbon may increase. This increase results in a reduction in boiler efficiency, requiring more coal to be burned to maintain the boiler output.  As the coal firing rate increases, there are corresponding increases in the solid waste generation and auxiliary power usage. The O&M costs were evaluated for tangential-fired boilers only.  With no changes in the capital cost for wall-fired boilers, the fixed O&M costs, generally taken as a function of the capital cost, are not expected to vary. Also, no changes in the variable O&M costs are expected, since unburned carbon assumptions are unchanged.  

For tangential-fired boilers, the general maintenance cost was conservatively taken as 1.5 percent of the total project cost for each technology.  Also, a plant capacity factor of 85 percent was assumed.     

Coal Cost:  $1.20/MMBtu
Solid waste disposal: $12/ton
Auxiliary power: 25 mills/KWh

Note: O&M cost components are in 1999 dollars, all others are in $2004."

When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.

When stack gas flow rate data was available, the costs and cost effectiveness were calculated using the typical values of capital and O&M costs.  When stack gas flow rate data was not available, default typical capital and O&M cost values based on a tons per year of PM10 removed were used (Pechan,2001).

Total annualized costs were determined by adding the annualized O&M costs, fixed capital recovery charges, and a fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs.  The fixed annual charge for taxes, insurance and administrative costs was estimated as 4 percent of the total capital investment (EPA, 2000).  Total installed capital costs were annualized using a capital recovery factor, with is based on a 7 percent discount rate and the expected life of the control equipment (20 years) (Pechan, 2001).

The range of high and low capital costs and O&M costs presented in the fact sheets were calculated based on the OAQPS Control Cost Manual and associated spreadsheets (EPA, 1996).  The low costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the maximum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with no exotic materials.  The high costs in the ranges below are representative of equipment sized based on the minimum flow rate recommended in the cost manual, with not exotic materials.  No optional pre- or post treatment equipment costs are included.

O&M Cost Components:  With the retrofit of combustion controls, the boiler unburned carbon may increase. This increase results in a reduction in boiler efficiency, requiring more coal to be burned to maintain the boiler output.  As the coal firing rate increases, there are corresponding increases in the solid waste generation and auxiliary power usage. The O&M costs were evaluated for tangential-fired boilers only.  With no changes in the capital cost for wall-fired boilers, the fixed O&M costs, generally taken as a function of the capital cost, are not expected to vary. Also, no changes in the variable O&M costs are expected, since unburned carbon assumptions are unchanged.  

For tangential-fired boilers, the general maintenance cost was conservatively taken as 1.5 percent of the total project cost for each technology.  Also, a plant capacity factor of 85 percent was assumed.     

Coal Cost:  $1.20/MMBtu
Solid waste disposal: $12/ton
Auxiliary power: 25 mills/KWh

In the IPM, model plants applying LNB had capacities of 300 MW.  The equations were scaled to develop costs for smaller or larger boilers than the model plant.  The cost equations also assume a capacity utilization factor of 85% for the utility boilers, as well as a 7% discount rate and 15-year lifetime of the controls.

Capital Costs (CC): 

Nameplate Capacity:  netdc [=] MW
Total Capital Costs:  TCC = $19.24 per kW
Scaling Factor:  SF = (sfn / netdc)^sfe = (300 / MW )^0.359

CC (for netdc < 500)  = TCC  * netdc * 1000 * SF
CC (for netdc > 500) = TCC  * netdc * 1000 

Operating & Maintenance (O&M):

Fixed O&M:  omf = $0.29 per kW per year
Variable O&M:  omv = $0.06 mills per kW-hr
Capacity Factor:  capfac = 0.85

O&M = ( omf * netdc * 1000) + ( omv * netdc * 1000 * capfac * 8760 / 1000)

Equipment Life in Years = Equiplife
Interest Rate = i
Capital Recovery Factor:  CRF = [ i ( 1 + i ) ^ Equiplife ] / [ (( 1 + i )^ Equiplife) - 1] 

Total Cost = (CRF * CC) + O&M

O&M Cost Components:  With the retrofit of combustion controls, the boiler unburned carbon may increase. This increase results in a reduction in boiler efficiency, requiring more coal to be burned to maintain the boiler output.  As the coal firing rate increases, there are corresponding increases in the solid waste generation and auxiliary power usage. The O&M costs were evaluated for tangential-fired boilers only.  With no changes in the capital cost for wall-fired boilers, the fixed O&M costs, generally taken as a function of the capital cost, are not expected to vary. Also, no changes in the variable O&M costs are expected, since unburned carbon assumptions are unchanged.  

For tangential-fired boilers, the general maintenance cost was conservatively taken as 1.5 percent of the total project cost for each technology.  Also, a plant capacity factor of 85 percent was assumed.     

Coal Cost:  $1.20/MMBtu
Solid waste disposal: $12/ton
Auxiliary power: 25 mills/KWh

Note:  All costs are in 1999 dollars."

The cost equations used in this analysis are based on cost equations developed to scale costs to smaller or larger boilers than the model plant (EPA, 1998).  Model plants were considered to have boiler design capacities of 500 MW.  Several simplifying assumptions were made in developing the costing parameters used for this analysis.  A capacity utilization factor of 65 percent was assumed, as well as a 7-percent discount rate and 15-year lifetime for the scrubber.  A control efficiency of 90 percent was assumed for scrubbers on all utility boiler fuel types.

The fuel sulfur content level for these equations is 2% sulfur.  

Capital Costs (CC): 

Nameplate Capacity:  netdc [=] MW
Total Capital Costs:  TCC = $149 per kW
Scaling Factor:  SF = (sfn / netdc)^sfe = (500 / MW )^0.6

CC (for netdc < 500)  = TCC * netdc * 1000 * SF
CC (for netdc > 500) = TCC * netdc * 1000 

Operating & Maintenance (O&M):

Fixed O&M:  omf = $5.40 per kW per year

O&M Cost Components:  The percentages of each O&M cost component were developed using EPAGÇÖs CUE Cost (EPA, 2000) program. O&M costs were calculated for the model plant and the percentage of the total O&M cost was then calculated for each O&M cost component. A credit for the sale of by-product was subtracted from the disposal costs.  A capacity factor of 65% was assumed. The following assumptions apply to the cost of utilities and disposal:

Calcium Carbonate                  15       $/ton
Dibasic acid                           430      $/ton
Disposal by gypsum stacking    6       $/ton
Disposal by landfill                  30       $/ton
Credit for by-product                2        $/ton
Steam                                  3.5       $/1000 lb
