SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

Applies to natural-gas fired reformers involved in the production of ammonia (SCC 30100306) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

EMx is a post-combustion catalytic oxidation and absorption technology that uses a two- stage catalyst/absorber system for the control of NOx as well as CO, VOC, and optionally SOx. A coated catalyst oxidizes NO to NO2, CO to CO2, and VOC to CO2 and water. The NO2 is then absorbed onto the catalyst surface where it is chemically converted to and stored as potassium nitrates and nitrites. A proprietary regeneration gas is periodically passed through the catalyst to desorb the NO2 from the catalyst and reduce it to elemental nitrogen (N2). EMx has been successfully demonstrated on several small combustion turbine projects up to 45 MW. The manufacturer has claimed that EMx can be effectively scaled up to larger turbines (CT-1).

This control applies to general manufacturing operations. This control applies to general glass manufacturing operations classified under SCC 30501401.

Discussion: The basic rationale for oxy-firing is improved efficiency, i.e., more of the theoretical heat of combustion is transferred to the glass melt and is not lost in the flue gas. Many other combustion modification techniques (e.g., flue gas recirculation, staged combustion, and low excess air combustion) reduce NOx formation but also reduce the combustion efficiency. Oxy-firing was originally developed to improve the combustion efficiency primarily by eliminating the sensible heat lost in heating the nitrogen present in air, which is then lost in the flue gas."

This control applies to bituminous coal-fired cement kilns (SCC 39000201) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.

The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.

SNCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).

This control applies to solid waste disposal operations (classified under SCC 50100506) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).  

Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002).

Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications.

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:

Reaction temperature range;
Residence time available in the optimum temperature range;
Degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases
Uncontrolled NOx concentration level;
Molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx ; and
Ammonia slip."

The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

This control is applicable to iron and steel annealing operations with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: LNBs are designed to ""stage"" combustion so that two combustion zones are created, one fuel-rich combustion and one at a lower temperature.  Staging techniques are usually used by LNB to supply excess air to cool the combustion process or to reduce available oxygen in the flame zone.  Staged-air LNB's create a fuel-rich reducing primary combustion zone and a fuel-lean secondary combustion zone.  Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002).

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).  

Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002).

Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications.

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:

Reaction temperature range;
Residence time available in the optimum temperature range;
Degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases
Uncontrolled NOx concentration level;
Molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx ; and ammonia slip."

Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002).

SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).  

Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002).

Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications.

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:

Reaction temperature range;
Residence time available in the optimum temperature range;
Degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases
Uncontrolled NOx concentration level;
Molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx ; and ammonia slip."

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

LNBs reduce the amount of NOx created from reaction between fuel nitrogen and oxygen by lowering the temperature of one combustion zone and reducing the amount of oxygen available in another.  SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

This control is applicable to small (40 to 174 MMBtu/hr) process gas-fired process heaters with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: LNBs are designed to ""stage"" combustion so that two combustion zones are created, one fuel-rich combustion and one at a lower temperature.  Staging techniques are usually used by LNB to supply excess air to cool the combustion process or to reduce available oxygen in the flame zone.  Staged-air LNB's create a fuel-rich reducing primary combustion zone and a fuel-lean secondary combustion zone.  Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002).

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

LNBs reduce the amount of NOx created from reaction between fuel nitrogen and oxygen by lowering the temperature of one combustion zone and reducing the amount of oxygen available in another.  SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures. 
Discussion: LNBs are designed to ""stage"" combustion so that two combustion zones are created, one fuel-rich combustion and one at a lower temperature.  Staging techniques are usually used by LNB to supply excess air to cool the combustion process or to reduce available oxygen in the flame zone.  Staged-air LNB's create a fuel-rich reducing primary combustion zone and a fuel-lean secondary combustion zone.  Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002). 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002). 
Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.   
The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required. 
The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water. 
Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

LNBs reduce the amount of NOx created from reaction between fuel nitrogen and oxygen by lowering the temperature of one combustion zone and reducing the amount of oxygen available in another.  SNCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  
Discussion: LNBs are designed to ""stage"" combustion so that two combustion zones are created, one fuel-rich combustion and one at a lower temperature.  Staging techniques are usually used by LNB to supply excess air to cool the combustion process or to reduce available oxygen in the flame zone.  Staged-air LNB's create a fuel-rich reducing primary combustion zone and a fuel-lean secondary combustion zone.  Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002). 
SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).   
Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002). 
Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water. 
Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications.

This control applies to dry-process cement manufacturing (SCC 30500606) and Natural Gas Cement Kilns (SCC 39000602) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent
reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of
the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O).

Applies to coke ICI boilers with NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002).

Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications."

This control applies to small (<1 ton NOx emissions per OSD) process gas fired process heaters with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).  

Both ammonia and urea are used as reagents. The cost of the reagent represents a large part of the annual costs of an SNCR system.  Ammonia is generally less expensive than urea. However, the choice of reagent is also based on physical properties and operational considerations (EPA, 2002).

Ammonia can be utilized in either aqueous or anhydrous form.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications."

This control applies to all coal-fired industrial boilers.

Discussion: There are two major coal combustion techniques in industrial boilers - suspension firing and grate firing.  Suspension firing is the primary combustion mechanism in pulverized-coal-fired and cyclone-fired units and overfeed stoker-fired units.  Both mechanisms are employed in spreader stokers.  Pulverized-coal and cyclone furnaces are used primarily in utility and large industrial boilers.

Stokers constitute the most practical method of firing coal for small industrial units.  In spreader stokers, a flipping mechanism throws the coal into the furnace and onto a moving fuel bed.  Combustion occurs partly in suspension and partly on the grate.  In overfeed stokers, coal is fed onto a traveling bed or vibrating grate, and it burns on the fuel bed as it progresses through the furnace (AWMA, 1992).

Discussion: Heavier fuel oil derived from crude petroleum are referred to as residual oils and are graded from No. 4 (very light residual) to No. 6 (residual).  Emissions from fuel oil combustion depend on the grade and composition of the oil, the type and size of the boiler, firing practices used, and the level of equipment maintenance.

This control applies to operations with wood-fired industrial boilers.

Discussion: The burning of wood and bark waste in boilers is mostly confined to industries where wood and bark waste is available as a byproduct.  Wood and bark waste is burned to obtain heat energy and to alleviate possible solid waste disposal problems.  In boilers, the waste is burned in the form of hogged wood, sawdust, shavings, chips, sander dust, or wood trim.  Bark is the major type of waste burned in ""power"" boilers at pulp and paper mills.  At lumber, furniture, and plywood plants, either a mixture of wood and bark waste or wood waste alone is burned most frequently (EPA, 1995).

This control applies to cement manufacturing operations.

Discussion: The largest source of particulate emissions at a cement plant is the kiln used to produce clinker.  Cement kilns are rotary kilns, which are slowly rotating refractory-lined steel cylinders inclined slightly from the horizontal.  Raw materials are fed into the top end of the kiln and spend several hours traversing the kiln.  In wet process kilns (SCC 30500706), the raw materials are fed as a wet slurry.  During this time, the raw materials are heated by a flame at the discharge end of the kiln.  This heating dries the raw materials, converts limestone to lime, and promotes reaction between and fusion of the separate ingredients to form clinker.  Clinker exiting the kiln is fed to a clinker cooler (SCC 30500714) for cooling before storage and further processing (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

This control applies to iron and steel production operations.

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.

Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In contrast to wet scrubbers which apply energy directly to the flowing fluid medium, an ESP applies energy only to the particulate matter being collected and therefore is very efficient in its consumption of energy (in the form of electricity).

Power plants, steel mills, pharmaceutical producers, food manufacturers, chemical producers and other industrial companies often use baghouses to control emission of air pollutants. Baghouses came into widespread use in the late 1970s after the invention of high-temperature fabrics (for use in the filter media) capable of withstanding temperatures over 350‚Äö√†√ªF.

Unlike electrostatic precipitators, where performance may vary significantly depending on process and electrical conditions, functioning baghouses typically have a particulate collection efficiency of 99% or better, even when particle size is very small.

Most baghouses use long, cylindrical bags (or tubes) made of woven or felted fabric as a filter medium. (For applications where there is relatively low dust loading and gas temperatures are 250‚Äö√†√ªF or less, pleated, nonwoven cartridges are sometimes used as filtering media instead of bags.) Dust-laden gas or air enters the baghouse through hoppers (large funnel-shaped containers used for storing and dispensing particulate) and is directed into the baghouse compartment. The gas is drawn through the bags, either on the inside or the outside depending on cleaning method, and a layer of dust accumulates on the filter media surface until air can no longer move through it. When sufficient pressure drop (delta P) occurs, the cleaning process begins. Cleaning can take place while the baghouse is online (filtering) or is offline (in isolation). When the compartment is clean, normal filtering resumes.

Baghouses are very efficient particulate collectors because of the dust cake formed on the surface of the bags. The fabric provides a surface on which dust collects through the following four mechanisms:

Inertial collection - Dust particles strike the fibers placed perpendicular to the gas-flow direction instead of changing direction with the gas stream.
Interception - Particles that do not cross the fluid streamlines come in contact with fibers because of the fiber size.
Brownian movement - Submicrometre particles are diffused, increasing the probability of contact between the particles and collecting surfaces.
Electrostatic forces - The presence of an electrostatic charge on the particles and the filter can increase dust capture.

A combination of these mechanisms results in formation of the dust cake on the filter, which eventually increases the resistance to gas flow. The filter must be cleaned periodically.

This control applies to asphalt manufacturing processes.

Discussion: In a fabric filter, flue gas is passed through a tightly woven or felted fabric, collecting PM by sieving and other mechanisms. Fabric filters may be in the form of sheets, cartridges, or bags, with many individual filter units together in a group. Bags are the most common type of filter. The dust cake that forms on the filter from the collected PM can significantly increase collection efficiency. (EPA, 2000)

Mechanical shaking is a popular cleaning method because it is both simple and effective. In typical operation, dusty gas enters an inlet pipe to the fabric filter and very large particles are removed using a baffle plate fall into the hopper. The gas stream is drawn from beneath a cell plate in the floor and into the filter bags (EPA, 2000). The gas proceeds from the inside to the outside of the filter bags. The particles collect on the inside of the bags, forming a filter cake. In mechanical shaking units, the tops of bags are attached to a shaker bar, moved briskly (usually in a horizontal direction) to clean the bags. The shaker bars are operated by mechanical motors or by hand (EPA, 1998).

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators.  Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).  Fabric filters may be good candidates for collecting fly ash from low-sulfur coals or containing high unburned carbon levels and are relatively difficult to collect with electrostatic precipitators.

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators.  Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).  Fabric filters may be good candidates for collecting fly ash from low-sulfur coals or containing high unburned carbon levels and are relatively difficult to collect with electrostatic precipitators.

This control applies to cement manufacturing operations.

Discussion: The largest source of particulate emissions at a cement plant is the kiln used to produce clinker.  Cement kilns are rotary kilns, which are slowly rotating refractory-lined steel cylinders inclined slightly from the horizontal.  Raw materials are fed into the top end of the kiln and spend several hours traversing the kiln.  In wet process kilns (SCC 30500706), the raw materials are fed as a wet slurry.  During this time, the raw materials are heated by a flame at the discharge end of the kiln.  This heating dries the raw materials, converts limestone to lime, and promotes reaction between and fusion of the separate ingredients to form clinker.  Clinker exiting the kiln is fed to a clinker cooler (SCC 30500714) for cooling before storage and further processing (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

This control applies to ferroalloy production operations, including (but not limited to) several processes within this industry were selected for control, basic oxygen process furnace (SCC 30300914) and EAF argon O2 decarb vessels (SCC 30300928).

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.

The gas stream is drawn from beneath a cell plate in the floor and into the filter bags (EPA, 2000). The gas proceeds from the inside to the outside of the filter bags. The particles collect on the inside of the bags, forming a filter cake. In mechanical shaking units, the tops of bags are attached to a shaker bar, moved briskly (usually in a horizontal direction) to clean the bags. The shaker bars are operated by mechanical motors or by hand (EPA, 1998).

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators.  Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).  Fabric filters may be good candidates for collecting fly ash from low-sulfur coals or containing high unburned carbon levels and are relatively difficult to collect with electrostatic precipitators.

Discussion: The burning of wood and bark waste in boilers is mostly confined to industries where wood and bark waste is available as a byproduct.  Wood and bark waste is burned to obtain heat energy and to alleviate possible solid waste disposal problems.  In boilers, the waste is burned in the form of hogged wood, sawdust, shavings, chips, sander dust, or wood trim.  Bark is the major type of waste burned in ""power"" boilers at pulp and paper mills.  At lumber, furniture, and plywood plants, either a mixture of wood and bark waste or wood waste alone is burned most frequently (EPA, 1995).

This control applies to coal cleaning PM10 and PM2.5 sources at mining operations.

Discussion: Coal mining, cleaning and material handling (305010) consists of the preparation and handling of coal to upgrade its value.  For the purpose of this study, thermal dryers, pneumatic coal cleaning and truck/vehicle travel are the sources considered.  Thermal dryers are used at the end of the series of cleaning operations to remove moisture from coal, thereby reducing freezing problems and weight, and increasing the heating value.  The major portion of water is removed by the use of screens, thickeners, and cyclones.  The coal is then dried in a thermal dryer.  Particulate emissions result from the entrainment of fine coal particles during the thermal drying process (EPA, 1995).  Pneumatic coal-cleaning equipment classifies bituminous coal by size or separates bituminous coal from refuse by application of air streams.  Fugitive PM emissions result when haul trucks or other vehicles travel on unpaved roads or surfaces.

Consequently, fabric filters cleaned by the pulse-jet method can be smaller than other filters in the treatment of the same amount of gas and dust, making higher gas-to-cloth ratios achievable (EPA, 1998).

Fabric filters are useful for collecting particles with resistivities either too low or too high for collection with electrostatic precipitators. Fabric filters are useful in controlling particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (�m) in diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5).

In a fabric filter, flue gas is passed through a tightly woven or felted fabric, collecting PM by sieving and other mechanisms.

This control applies to electricity generation sources powered by pulverized dry-bottom and bituminous/subbituminous coal.

Discussion: The largest source of particulate emissions at a cement plant is the kiln used to produce clinker.  Cement kilns are rotary kilns, which are slowly rotating refractory-lined steel cylinders inclined slightly from the horizontal.  Raw materials are fed into the top end of the kiln and spend several hours traversing the kiln.  In wet process kilns (SCC 30500706), the raw materials are fed as a wet slurry.  During this time, the raw materials are heated by a flame at the discharge end of the kiln.  This heating dries the raw materials, converts limestone to lime, and promotes reaction between and fusion of the separate ingredients to form clinker.  Clinker exiting the kiln is fed to a clinker cooler (SCC 30500714) for cooling before storage and further processing (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

In a fabric filter, flue gas is passed through a tightly woven or felted fabric, collecting PM by sieving and other mechanisms. Fabric filters may be in the form of sheets, cartridges, or bags, with many individual filter units together in a group. Bags are the most common type of filter. The dust cake that forms on the filter from the collected PM can significantly increase collection efficiency. (EPA, 2000)

Pulse-jet cleaning of fabric filters is a relatively new type of fabric filter, as they have only been used for the past 30 years. This cleaning mechanism has grown in popularity because it can treat high dust loadings, operate at constant pressure drop, and occupy less space than other types of fabric filters (EPA, 2000).  Particulate-laden gas flows into the bag. The gas flows from the outside to the inside of the bags, and then out the gas exhaust. The particles collected on the outside drop into a hopper below the fabric filter (EPA, 1998). 

During pulse-jet cleaning, a short burst of high pressure air is injected into the bags (EPA, 1998).  The pulse is blown through a venturi nozzle at the top of the bags and establishes a shock wave that continues onto the bottom of the bag. The wave flexes the fabric dislodging the dust cake.

There are several unique attributes of pulse-jet cleaning. The cleaning pulse is very brief allowing the flow of dusty gas to continue during cleaning. The bags not being cleaned continue to filter, taking on extra duty from the bags being cleaned (EPA, 2000).  Pulse-jet cleaning is more intense and occurs with greater frequency than the other fabric filter cleaning methods. The cleaning dislodges nearly all of the dust cake each time the bag is pulsed.  Pulse-jet filters, as a result, do not rely on a dust cake to provide filtration.  Felted (non-woven) fabrics are used in these types of filters because they do not require a dust cake.

This control applies to iron and steel production operations.

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.

This control applies to operations with coal-fired boilers.

Discussion: There are two major coal combustion techniques in industrial boilers - suspension firing and grate firing.  Suspension firing is the primary combustion mechanism in pulverized-coal-fired and cyclone-fired units and overfeed stoker-fired units.  Both mechanisms are employed in spreader stokers.  Pulverized-coal and cyclone furnaces are used primarily in utility and large industrial boilers.

Stokers constitute the most practical method of firing coal for small industrial units.  In spreader stokers, a flipping mechanism throws the coal into the furnace and onto a moving fuel bed.  Combustion occurs partly in suspension and partly on the grate.  In overfeed stokers, coal is fed onto a traveling bed or vibrating grate, and it burns on the fuel bed as it progresses through the furnace (AWMA, 1992).

This control applies to coal cleaning at coal mining operations.  .

Discussion: Coal mining, cleaning and material handling (305010) consists of the preparation and handling of coal to upgrade its value.  For the purpose of this study, thermal dryers, pneumatic coal cleaning and truck/vehicle travel are the sources considered.  Thermal dryers are used at the end of the series of cleaning operations to remove moisture from coal, thereby reducing freezing problems and weight, and increasing the heating value.  The major portion of water is removed by the use of screens, thickeners, and cyclones.  The coal is then dried in a thermal dryer.  Particulate emissions result from the entrainment of fine coal particles during the thermal drying process (EPA, 1995).  Pneumatic coal-cleaning equipment classifies bituminous coal by size or separates bituminous coal from refuse by application of air streams.  Fugitive PM emissions result when haul trucks or other vehicles travel on unpaved roads or surfaces.

This control applies to cement manufacturing operations.

Discussion: The largest source of particulate emissions at a cement plant is the kiln used to produce clinker.  Cement kilns are rotary kilns, which are slowly rotating refractory-lined steel cylinders inclined slightly from the horizontal.  Raw materials are fed into the top end of the kiln and spend several hours traversing the kiln.  In wet process kilns (SCC 30500706), the raw materials are fed as a wet slurry.  During this time, the raw materials are heated by a flame at the discharge end of the kiln.  This heating dries the raw materials, converts limestone to lime, and promotes reaction between and fusion of the separate ingredients to form clinker.  Clinker exiting the kiln is fed to a clinker cooler (SCC 30500714) for cooling before storage and further processing (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

This control applies to ferroalloy production operations, including (but not limited to) several processes within this industry were selected for control, basic oxygen process furnace (SCC 30300914) and EAF argon O2 decarb vessels (SCC 30300928).

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.

This control applies to iron and steel production operations.

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.

An impingement-plate scrubber is a vertical chamber with plates mounted horizontally inside a hollow shell. Impingement-plate scrubbers operate as countercurrent PM collection devices. The scrubbing liquid flows down the tower while the gas stream flows upward. Contact between the liquid and the particle-laden gas occurs on the plates. The plates are equipped with openings that allow the gas to pass through. Some plates are perforated or slotted, while more complex plates have valve-like openings (EPA, 1998).

This control applies to iron and steel production operations.

Discussion: In all types of impingement-plate scrubbers, the scrubbing liquid flows across each plate and down the inside of the tower onto the plate below. After the bottom plate, the liquid and collected PM flow out of the bottom of the tower. Impingement-plate scrubbers are usually designed to provide operator access to each tray, making them relatively easy to clean and maintain. Consequently, impingement-plate scrubbers are more suitable for PM collection than packed-bed scrubbers. Particles greater than 1 um in aerodynamic diameter can be collected effectively by impingement-plate scrubbers, but many particles <1 um in aerodynamic diameter will penetrate these devices (EPA, 1998).

The simplest impingement-plate scrubber is the sieve plate, which has round perforations (EPA, 1999). In this type of scrubber, the scrubbing liquid flows over the plates and the gas flows up through the holes. The gas velocity prevents the liquid from flowing down through the perforations. Gas-liquid-particle contact is achieved within the froth generated by the gas passing through the liquid layer. Complex plates, such as bubble cap or baffle plates, introduce an additional means of collecting PM. The bubble caps and baffles placed above the plate perforations force the gas to turn before escaping the layer of liquid. While the gas turns to avoid the obstacles, most PM cannot and is collected by impaction on the caps or baffles. Bubble caps and the like also prevent liquid from flowing down the perforations if the gas flow is reduced (EPA, 1998)."

Discussion: Materials handling operations including crushing, grinding, and screening, can produce significant PM emissions.  Drying, the heating of minerals or mineral products to remove water, and calcination, heating to higher temperatures to remove chemically bound water and other compounds, are normally performed in dedicated, closed units.  Emissions from these units will be through process vents, to which PM controls can be applied relatively simply.  Fugitive dust emissions may come from paved and unpaved roads in plants and from raw material and product loading, unloading, and storage (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

Pollutants that require an unusually high level of control or that require the filter media or the unit itself to be constructed of special materials, such as Nomex � or stainless steel, will increase the costs of the system (EPA, 1998). In general, a small unit controlling a low pollutant loading will not be as cost effective as a large unit controlling a high pollutant loading (EPA, 2000).

In general, the filter media is pleated to provide a larger surface area to volume flow rate.  Close pleating, however, can cause PM to bridge the pleat bottom, effectively reducing the surface collection area (EPA, 1998b).  Corrugated aluminum separators are used to prevent the pleats from collapsing (Heumann, 1997).  There are variety of cartridge designs and dimensions. Typical designs include flat panels, V-shaped packs or cylindrical packs (Heumann, 1997).  For certain applications, two cartridges may be placed in series.

This control measure applies to coal cleaning processes at coal mining operations.

Discussion: Coal mining, cleaning and material handling (305010) consists of the preparation and handling of coal to upgrade its value.  For the purpose of this study, thermal dryers, pneumatic coal cleaning and truck/vehicle travel are the sources considered.  Thermal dryers are used at the end of the series of cleaning operations to remove moisture from coal, thereby reducing freezing problems and weight, and increasing the heating value.  The major portion of water is removed by the use of screens, thickeners, and cyclones.  The coal is then dried in a thermal dryer.  Particulate emissions result from the entrainment of fine coal particles during the thermal drying process (EPA, 1995).  Pneumatic coal-cleaning equipment classifies bituminous coal by size or separates bituminous coal from refuse by application of air streams.  Fugitive PM emissions result when haul trucks or other vehicles travel on unpaved roads or surfaces.

The cost estimates assume a conventional design under typical operating conditions. Auxiliary equipment, such as fans and ductwork, is not included (EPA, 2000).  Pollutants that require an unusually high level of control or that require the filter media or the unit itself to be constructed of special materials, such as Nomex � or stainless steel, will increase the costs of the system (EPA, 1998).  In general, a small unit controlling a low pollutant loading will not be as cost effective as a large unit controlling a high pollutant loading (EPA, 2000).

Cartridge filters contain either a paper or nonwoven fibrous filter media (EPA, 2000).  Paper media is generally made of materials such as cellulose and fiberglass.  The dust cake that forms on the filter media from the collected PM can significantly increase collection efficiency (EPA, 1998).

In general, the filter media is pleated to provide a larger surface area to volume flow rate.  Close pleating, however, can cause PM to bridge the pleat bottom, effectively reducing the surface collection area (EPA, 1998b).  Corrugated aluminum separators are used to prevent the pleats from collapsing (Heumann, 1997).  There are variety of cartridge designs and dimensions. Typical designs include flat panels, V-shaped packs or cylindrical packs (Heumann, 1997).  For certain applications, two cartridges may be placed in series.

This control measure applies to cement manufacturing operations.

Discussion: The largest source of particulate emissions at a cement plant is the kiln used to produce clinker.  Cement kilns are rotary kilns, which are slowly rotating refractory-lined steel cylinders inclined slightly from the horizontal.  Raw materials are fed into the top end of the kiln and spend several hours traversing the kiln.  In wet process kilns (SCC 30500706), the raw materials are fed as a wet slurry.  During this time, the raw materials are heated by a flame at the discharge end of the kiln.  This heating dries the raw materials, converts limestone to lime, and promotes reaction between and fusion of the separate ingredients to form clinker.  Clinker exiting the kiln is fed to a clinker cooler (SCC 30500714) for cooling before storage and further processing (STAPPA/ALAPCO, 1996).

A scrubber is a type of technology that removes air pollutants by inertial and diffusional interception.  A venturi scrubber accelerates the waste gas stream to atomize the scrubbing liquid and to improve gas-liquid contact.  

This control applies to operations with coal-fired boilers.

Discussion: There are two major coal combustion techniques in industrial boilers - suspension firing and grate firing.  Suspension firing is the primary combustion mechanism in pulverized-coal-fired and cyclone-fired units and overfeed stoker-fired units.  Both mechanisms are employed in spreader stokers.  Pulverized-coal and cyclone furnaces are used primarily in utility and large industrial boilers.

Stokers constitute the most practical method of firing coal for small industrial units.  In spreader stokers, a flipping mechanism throws the coal into the furnace and onto a moving fuel bed.  Combustion occurs partly in suspension and partly on the grate.  In overfeed stokers, coal is fed onto a traveling bed or vibrating grate, and it burns on the fuel bed as it progresses through the furnace (AWMA, 1992).

By product coke production is used to manufacture metallurgical coke by heating high-grade bituminous coal (low sulfur and low ash) in an enclosed oven chamber without oxygen.  The resulting solid material consists of elemental carbon and any minerals (ash) that were present in the coal blend that did not volatilize during the process.

A venturi scrubber accelerates the waste gas stream to improve gas-liquid contact. In a venturi scrubber, a ""throat'"" section is built into the duct that forces the gas stream to accelerate (EPA, 1999).  As the gas enters the venturi throat, both gas velocity and turbulence increase. 

After the throat section, the mixture decelerates, and further impacts occur causing the droplets to agglomerate. Once the particles have been captured by the liquid, the wetted PM and excess liquid are separated from the gas stream through entrainment.  This section usually consists of a cyclonic separator and/or a mist eliminator (EPA, 1998; Corbitt, 1990).

For PM applications, wet scrubbers generate waste, either a slurry or wet sludge. This creates the need for both wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal.  Initially, the slurry is treated to separate the solid waste from the water (EPA, 1999).  The treated water can then be reused or  discharged. Once the water is removed, the remaining waste will be in the form of a solid or sludge. If the solid waste is inert and nontoxic, it can generally be land filled.  Hazardous wastes will have more stringent procedures for disposal.  In some cases, the solid waste may have value and can be sold or recycled (EPA, 1998)."

This control applies to operations with oil-fired boilers.

Discussion: Fuel-oil types include heavier fuel oil derived from crude petroleum are referred to as residual oils and are graded from No. 4 (very light residual) to No. 6 (residual).  Emissions from fuel oil combustion depend on the grade and composition of the oil, the type and size of the boiler, firing practices used, and the level of equipment maintenance.

The costs do not include costs for post-treatment or disposal of used solvent or waste. Actual costs can be substantially higher than in the ranges shown for applications which require expensive materials, solvents, or treatment methods (EPA, 1999). As a rule, smaller units controlling a low concentration waste stream will be much more expensive (per unit volumetric flow rate) than a large unit cleaning a high pollutant load flow.

By product coke production is used to manufacture metallurgical coke by heating high-grade bituminous coal (low sulfur and low ash) in an enclosed oven chamber without oxygen.

Discussion: The burning of wood and bark waste in boilers is mostly confined to industries where wood and bark waste is available as a byproduct.  Wood and bark waste is burned to obtain heat energy and to alleviate possible solid waste disposal problems.  In boilers, the waste is burned in the form of hogged wood, sawdust, shavings, chips, sander dust, or wood trim.  Bark is the major type of waste burned in ""power"" boilers at pulp and paper mills.  At lumber, furniture, and plywood plants, either a mixture of wood and bark waste or wood waste alone is burned most frequently (EPA, 1995).

Discussion: Grey iron is an alloy of iron, carbon, and silicon, containing a higher percentage of the last two elements than found in malleable iron.

A scrubber is a type of technology that removes air pollutants by inertial and diffusional interception.  A venturi scrubber accelerates the waste gas stream to atomize the scrubbing liquid and to improve gas-liquid contact.  

This control applies to iron and steel processing and production operations.

Discussion: Steel normally is produced in either basic oxygen process furnaces or electric arc furnaces.  In the basic oxygen process furnace, a mixture of 70 percent molten iron from the blast furnace and 30 percent iron scrap are melted together.  Pure oxygen is blown across the top or through the molten steel to oxidize carbon and oxygen impurities, thus removing these from the steel.  Basic oxygen process furnaces are large open-mouthed furnaces that can be tilted to accept a charge or to tap the molten steel to a charging ladle for transfer to an ingot mold or continuous caster.

Because basic oxygen furnaces are open, they produce significant uncontrolled particulate emissions, notably during the refining stage when oxygen is being blown.  Electric arc furnaces use the current passing between carbon electrodes to heat molten steel, but also use oxy-fuel burners to accelerate the initial melting process.  These furnaces are charged largely with scrap iron.  Significant emissions occur during charging, when the furnace roof is open, during melting, as the electrodes are lowered into the scrap and the arc is struck, and during tapping, when alloying elements are added to the melt.  

By product coke production is used to manufacture metallurgical coke by heating high-grade bituminous coal (low sulfur and low ash) in an enclosed oven chamber without oxygen.  The resulting solid material consists of elemental carbon and any minerals (ash) that were present in the coal blend that did not volatilize during the process.  Sources of air emissions consist of coke oven doors, coke oven lids and off-takes, coke oven charging, coke oven pushing, coke oven underfire stack, coke quenching, battery venting, and coke by-product-recovery plants.

A venturi scrubber accelerates the waste gas stream to improve gas-liquid contact. In a venturi scrubber, a ""throat'"" section is built into the duct that forces the gas stream to accelerate (EPA, 1999).  As the gas enters the venturi throat, both gas velocity and turbulence increase. 

After the throat section, the mixture decelerates, and further impacts occur causing the droplets to agglomerate. Once the particles have been captured by the liquid, the wetted PM and excess liquid are separated from the gas stream through entrainment.  This section usually consists of a cyclonic separator and/or a mist eliminator (EPA, 1998; Corbitt, 1990).

For PM applications, wet scrubbers generate waste, either a slurry or wet sludge. This creates the need for both wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal.  Initially, the slurry is treated to separate the solid waste from the water (EPA, 1999).  The treated water can then be reused or  discharged. Once the water is removed, the remaining waste will be in the form of a solid or sludge. If the solid waste is inert and nontoxic, it can generally be land filled.  Hazardous wastes will have more stringent procedures for disposal.  In some cases, the solid waste may have value and can be sold or recycled (EPA, 1998)."

An ESP uses electrical forces to move particles in an exhaust stream onto collector plates. Electrodes in the center of the flow are maintained at high voltage and generate an electrical field forcing particles to the collector walls.  Wet ESPs use a stream of water, in place of rapping mechanisms, to dislodge particulate from the plates and into a sump.

This control applies to various chemical manufacturing operations, including (but not limited to) adipic acid, ammonia, carbon black, charcoal, cleaners, phosphoric acids, plastics, sulfuric acid, sodium carbonate, ammonium nitrate, rubbers, ammonium phosphates, and  inorganic pigments.

Discussion: In the wire-plate ESP, the gas flows around vertical, metal plates.  The electrodes are long, weighted wires hanging between the plates.  The voltage applied to the electrodes causes the gas between the electrodes to break down, known as a ""corona."" The electrodes are most often given a negative polarity because a negative corona supports a higher voltage than a positive corona.

Certain types of losses affect control efficiency. The dislodging of the accumulated layer also projects some of the particles back into the gas stream. These particles are processed in later sections of the ESP, but the particles from the last section have no chance to be recaptured. Due to the space needed at the top of the ESP for nonelectrified components, part of the stream may flow around the charged zones. This is called ""sneakage"" and places an upper limit on the collection efficiency of the ESP.  Anti-sneakage baffles are used to force the sneakage flow to mix with the main gas stream for collection in later sections (EPA, 1998).

Wire-Plate Type Wet ESPs require a source of wash water near the top of the collector plates. This wash system replaces the rapping mechanism used by dry ESPs.  The water flows with the collected particles into a sump from which the fluid is pumped or drained.  A portion of the fluid may be recycled to reduce the total amount of water required. The remainder is pumped into a settling pond or passed through a dewatering stage, with subsequent disposal of the sludge (AWMA, 1992).

Unlike dry ESPs, resistivity of the collected material is not a major factor in performance.  Because of the high humidity in a wet ESP, the resistivity of particles is lowered, eliminating the ""back corona"" condition.  The frequent washing of the plates also limits particle buildup on the collectors (EPA, 1998).

For wet ESPs, the handling wastewaters must be considered (EPA, 1999). For simple systems with innocuous dusts, water with particles collected by the ESP may be discharged from the ESP system to a solids-removing clarifier.  More complicated systems may require skimming and sludge removal, clarification in dedicated equipment, pH adjustment, and/or treatment to remove dissolved solids.

This control applies to zinc processing and production operations.

Discussion: In the wire-plate ESP, the gas flows around vertical, metal plates.  The electrodes are long, weighted wires hanging between the plates.  The voltage applied to the electrodes causes the gas between the electrodes to break down, known as a ""corona."" The electrodes are most often given a negative polarity because a negative corona supports a higher voltage than a positive corona.

Certain types of losses affect control efficiency. The dislodging of the accumulated layer also projects some of the particles back into the gas stream. These particles are processed in later sections of the ESP, but the particles from the last section have no chance to be recaptured. Due to the space needed at the top of the ESP for nonelectrified components, part of the stream may flow around the charged zones. This is called ""sneakage"" and places an upper limit on the collection efficiency of the ESP.  Anti-sneakage baffles are used to force the sneakage flow to mix with the main gas stream for collection in later sections (EPA, 1998).

Wire-Plate Type Wet ESPs require a source of wash water near the top of the collector plates. This wash system replaces the rapping mechanism used by dry ESPs.  The water flows with the collected particles into a sump from which the fluid is pumped or drained.  A portion of the fluid may be recycled to reduce the total amount of water required. The remainder is pumped into a settling pond or passed through a dewatering stage, with subsequent disposal of the sludge (AWMA, 1992).

Unlike dry ESPs, resistivity of the collected material is not a major factor in performance.  Because of the high humidity in a wet ESP, the resistivity of particles is lowered, eliminating the ""back corona"" condition.  The frequent washing of the plates also limits particle buildup on the collectors (EPA, 1998).

For wet ESPs, the handling wastewaters must be considered (EPA, 1999). For simple systems with innocuous dusts, water with particles collected by the ESP may be discharged from the ESP system to a solids-removing clarifier.  More complicated systems may require skimming and sludge removal, clarification in dedicated equipment, pH adjustment, and/or treatment to remove dissolved solids.  Recirculation of treated water to the ESP may approach 100 percent (AWMA, 1992)."

This control applies to primary lead smelters with contact absorption.

Discussion: The contact process is used to produce sulfuric acid from waste gas which contains SO2.  First, the waste gas must be pretreated, which usually involves dust removal, cooling, and scrubbing for further removal of particulate matter and heavy metals, mist, and moisture.  After pretreatment, the gas is heated and passed through a catalytic converter (platinum mass units or units containing beds of pelletized vanadium pentoxide) to oxidize the SO2 to SO3.  The exothermic, reversible oxidation reaction results in a conflict between high equilibrium conversions at lower temperatures and high reaction rates at high temperatures.  Because of this, the gas is passed between the catalyst and two or three different heat exchangers in order to achieve conversion of SO2 to SO3 of about 92.5 to 98 percent.  The gas leaving the final catalyst stage is cooled and introduced to an absorption tower by a stream of strong (98 to 99 percent) acid, where the SO3 reacts with water in the acid to form additional sulfuric acid.  Dilute sulfuric acid or water is added to the recirculating acid to maintain the desired concentration (EPA, 1981; EPA, 1997).

The double-contact, or double-absorption, process for making sulfuric acid from waste gas containing SO2 is essentially the same as the single-contact process with the addition of an interpass absorption tower.  The waste gas is cleaned and dried as in the single-contact process before entering the process.  Upon leaving the second or third catalyst bed, depending upon the process, the gas is cooled and introduced to a packed-bed, counter-current absorption tower where it contacts 98 to 99 percent sulfuric acid.  After the absorbing tower, the gas is reheated and passed to the third or fourth catalyst bed, where approximately 97 percent of the remaining SO2 is converted to SO3 and passed to the final absorption tower for conversion to sulfuric acid as in the single-contact process.  No cost data were available for either single- or double-contact sulfuric acid plants controls (EPA, 1981; EPA, 1997)."

This control applies to sulfuric acid plants with contact absorption processes at 93% sulfur conversion efficiency.

Discussion: The contact process is used to produce sulfuric acid from waste gas which contains SO2.  First, the waste gas must be pretreated, which usually involves dust removal, cooling, and scrubbing for further removal of particulate matter and heavy metals, mist, and moisture.  After pretreatment, the gas is heated and passed through a catalytic converter (platinum mass units or units containing beds of pelletized vanadium pentoxide) to oxidize the SO2 to SO3.  The exothermic, reversible oxidation reaction results in a conflict between high equilibrium conversions at lower temperatures and high reaction rates at high temperatures.  Because of this, the gas is passed between the catalyst and two or three different heat exchangers in order to achieve conversion of SO2 to SO3 of about 92.5 to 98 percent.  The gas leaving the final catalyst stage is cooled and introduced to an absorption tower by a stream of strong (98 to 99 percent) acid, where the SO3 reacts with water in the acid to form additional sulfuric acid.  Dilute sulfuric acid or water is added to the recirculating acid to maintain the desired concentration (EPA, 1981; EPA, 1997).

The double-contact, or double-absorption, process for making sulfuric acid from waste gas containing SO2 is essentially the same as the single-contact process with the addition of an interpass absorption tower.  The waste gas is cleaned and dried as in the single-contact process before entering the process.  Upon leaving the second or third catalyst bed, depending upon the process, the gas is cooled and introduced to a packed-bed, counter-current absorption tower where it contacts 98 to 99 percent sulfuric acid.  After the absorbing tower, the gas is reheated and passed to the third or fourth catalyst bed, where approximately 97 percent of the remaining SO2 is converted to SO3 and passed to the final absorption tower for conversion to sulfuric acid as in the single-contact process.  No cost data were available for either single- or double-contact sulfuric acid plants controls (EPA, 1981; EPA, 1997)."

"Wet Scrubber; ICI Boilers (Coal)","SWSICIBC","SO2","Wet Scrubber","ICI Boilers (Coal)","ptnonipm","Known",15,,2014,"151",,"Wet Scrubber - This describes a variety of devices that remove pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants. 

The design of wet scrubbers or any air pollution control device depends on the industrial process conditions and the nature of the air pollutants involved. Inlet gas characteristics and dust properties (if particles are present) are of primary importance. Scrubbers can be designed to collect particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutants. The versatility of wet scrubbers allows them to be built in numerous configurations, all designed to provide good contact between the liquid and polluted gas stream.

Wet scrubbers remove dust particles by capturing them in liquid droplets. The droplets are then collected, the liquid dissolving or absorbing the pollutant gases. Any droplets that are in the scrubber inlet gas must be separated from the outlet gas stream by means of another device referred to as a mist eliminator or entrainment separator (these terms are interchangeable). Also, the resultant scrubbing liquid must be treated prior to any ultimate discharge or being reused in the plant.

A wet scrubber's ability to collect small particles is often directly proportional to the power input into the scrubber. Low energy devices such as spray towers are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high energy devices such as venturi scrubbers or augmented devices such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator the higher the potential emission levels.

Wet scrubbers that remove gaseous pollutants are referred to as absorbers. Good gas-to-liquid contact is essential to obtain high removal efficiencies in absorbers. A number of wet scrubber designs are used to remove gaseous pollutants, with the packed tower and the plate tower being the most common.

If the gas stream contains both particle matter and gases, wet scrubbers are generally the only single air pollution control device that can remove both pollutants. Wet scrubbers can achieve high removal efficiencies for either particles or gases and, in some instances, can achieve a high removal efficiency for both pollutants in the same system. However, in many cases, the best operating conditions for particles collection are the poorest for gas removal.

Previous federal actions that affected this source category include a 1977 CTG, a 1982 NSPS and a 2003 NESHAP (Surface Coating of Metal Furniture). In the 2007 CTG, EPA recommended three alternatives: (1) emission limits that can be achieved through the use of low VOC Coatings; (2) equivalent emission limits that can be achieved through the use of low-VOC coatings and add-on controls, (3) an overall control efficiency of 90 percent for add-on controls. The low-VOC coatings recommendation consists of emission limits in terms of mass of VOC per volume of coating, excluding water and exempt compounds, as applied and the use of specified application methods. The equivalent emission limit recommendation consists of emission limits in terms of mass of VOC per volume of coating solids, as applied, and the use of specific add-on controls.

The CTG recommends the use of low-VOC content (monomer and non-monomer VOC) resin and gel coats with specified application methods. The CTG recommends the use of covers on mixing containers to further reduce VOC emissions from gel coats and resins. The CTG also recommends the use of low-VOC and low vapor pressure cleaning materials. Because the CTG recommendations are based on the 2001 NESHAP for boat manufacturing, those facilities that are major sources of HAP are already complying with the 2001 NESHAP and have already adopted these control measures. Because the 2001 NESHAP does not apply to area sources, area source fiberglass boat manufacturing facilities are not currently required to implement the measures provided in the NESHAP and recommended in the CTG. There are boat manufacturing facilities in ozone nonattainment areas that meet the applicability threshold in the CTG and would provide VOC emission reductions when the CTG recommended controls are applied.

The emission limits in the OTC rule were the same as California ARB RACT standards, which were based on numerous California district rules. EPA recommends that the control approaches suggested apply to each miscellaneous industrial adhesive application process at a facility where the total actual VOC emissions from all application processes, including related cleaning activities at that facility are equal to or exceed 15 lbs per day before consideration of controls. EPA recommends specific VOC emission limits based on application processes. There are two options for achieving recommended emission limits: (1) through the use of low-VOC content adhesives and specified application methods with good adhesive transfer efficiency; or (2) through the use of a combination of low-VOC adhesives, specified methods and add-on controls.

This category  includes the industrial cleaning solvents used by many industries. It includes a variety of products that are used to remove contaminants such as adhesives, inks, paint, dirt, soil, oil and grease. The recommended measures for controlling VOC emissions from the use, storage and disposal of industrial cleaning solvents includes work practice standards, limitations on VOC content of the cleaning materials, and an optional alternative limit on composite vapor pressure of the cleaning materials. They also include the use of add-on controls with an overall emission reduction of at least 85 percent by mass. The first two recommendations and the last one are based on the Bay Area AQMD rule. On average, there is a cost savings associated with replacing high-VOC cleaning materials with low-VOC, waterbased cleaning materials. Facilities may either incur minimal additional costs or realize a savings on a case-by-case basis, depending primarily on how much they currently spend to operate the high VOC content solvent-based parts cleaners, the cost of organic solvent disposal, and air emission fees levied for VOC emissions."
