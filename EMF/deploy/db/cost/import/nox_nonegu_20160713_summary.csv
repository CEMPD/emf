SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

Applies to natural-gas fired reformers involved in the production of ammonia (SCC 30100306) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."

Catalytic combustors reduce the amount of NOx created by oxidizing fuel at lower temperatures (and without a flame) than in conventional combustors. Catalytic combustion uses a catalytic bed to oxidize a lean air fuel mixture within a combustor instead of burning with a flame. The fuel and air mixture oxidizes at lower temperatures than in a conventional combustor, producing less NOx.

Currently installed only on a few 1.4 MW combustion turbines, and commercially available for turbines rated up to 10 MW (CT-1)."

EMx is a post-combustion catalytic oxidation and absorption technology that uses a two- stage catalyst/absorber system for the control of NOx as well as CO, VOC, and optionally SOx. A coated catalyst oxidizes NO to NO2, CO to CO2, and VOC to CO2 and water. The NO2 is then absorbed onto the catalyst surface where it is chemically converted to and stored as potassium nitrates and nitrites. A proprietary regeneration gas is periodically passed through the catalyst to desorb the NO2 from the catalyst and reduce it to elemental nitrogen (N2). EMx has been successfully demonstrated on several small combustion turbine projects up to 45 MW. The manufacturer has claimed that EMx can be effectively scaled up to larger turbines (CT-1).

Oxygen enrichment refers to the substitution of oxygen for nitrogen in the combustion air used to burn the fuel in a glass furnace. Oxygen enrichment above 90 percent is sometimes called ""oxy-firing.""

This control applies to general manufacturing operations. This control applies to general glass manufacturing operations classified under SCC 30501401.

Discussion: The basic rationale for oxy-firing is improved efficiency, i.e., more of the theoretical heat of combustion is transferred to the glass melt and is not lost in the flue gas. Many other combustion modification techniques (e.g., flue gas recirculation, staged combustion, and low excess air combustion) reduce NOx formation but also reduce the combustion efficiency. Oxy-firing was originally developed to improve the combustion efficiency primarily by eliminating the sensible heat lost in heating the nitrogen present in air, which is then lost in the flue gas."
