SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.

Applies to natural-gas fired reformers involved in the production of ammonia (SCC 30100306) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s.  SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule.  The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002).  A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx.  

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges.  However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures.  There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002).  Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure.  Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002).  

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include:  reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001)."
