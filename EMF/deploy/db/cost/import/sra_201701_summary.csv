SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures.Discussion: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been widely applied to stationary source, fossil fuel-fired, combustion units for emission control since the early 1970s. SCR is typically implemented on units requiring a higher level of NOx control than achievable by SNCR or other combustion controls (EPA, 2002).

Like SNCR, SCR is based on the chemical reduction of the NOx molecule. The primary difference between SNCR and SCR is that SCR uses a metal-based catalyst to increase the rate of reaction (EPA, 2002). A nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea, is injected into the flue gas. The reagent reacts selectively with the flue gas NOx within a specific temperature range and in the presence of the catalyst and oxygen to reduce the NOx. 

The use of a catalyst results in two advantages of the SCR process over SNCR, the higher NOx reduction efficiency and the lower and broader temperature ranges. However, the decrease in reaction temperature and increase in efficiency is accompanied by a significant increase in capital and operating costs (EPA, 2002). The cost increase is due to the large amount of catalyst required.

The SCR system can utilize either aqueous or anhydrous ammonia as the reagent. Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures. There are safety issues with the use of anhydrous ammonia, as it must be transported and stored under pressure (EPA, 2002). Aqueous ammonia is generally transported and stored at a concentration of 29.4% ammonia in water.

Today, catalyst formulations include single component, multi-component, or active phase with a support structure. Most catalyst formulations contain additional compounds or sup-ports, providing thermal and structural stability or to increase surface area (EPA, 2002). 

The rate of reaction determines the amount of NOx removed from the flue gas. The important design and operational factors that affect the rate of reduction include: reaction temperature range; residence time available in the optimum temperature range; degree of mixing between the injected reagent and the combustion gases; uncontrolled NOx concentration level; molar ratio of injected reagent to uncontrolled NOx; ammonia slip; catalyst activity; catalyst selectivity; pressure drop across the catalyst; catalyst pitch; catalyst deactivation; and catalyst management (EPA, 2001).


This control applies to natural gas fired turbines with NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

This control applies to wet-process cement manufacturing (SCC 30600606) with uncontrolled NOx emissions greater than 10 tons per year.

Discussion: SNCR is the reduction of NOx in flue gas to N2 and water vapor.  This reduction is done with a nitrogen based reducing reagent, such as ammonia or urea. The reagent can react with a number of flue gas components. However, the NOx reduction reaction is favored for a specific temperature range and in the presence of oxygen (EPA, 2002).  

Urea based systems have several advantages, including several safety aspects.  Urea is a nontoxic, less volatile liquid that can be stored and handled more safely than ammonia.  Urea solution droplets can penetrate farther into the flue gas when injected into the boiler, enhancing mixing (EPA, 2002).  Because of these advantages, urea is more commonly used than ammonia in large boiler applications."

LNBs reduce the amount of NOx created from reaction between fuel nitrogen and oxygen by lowering the temperature of one combustion zone and reducing the amount of oxygen available in another.  SCR controls are post-combustion control technologies based on the chemical reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into molecular nitrogen (N2) and water vapor  (H2O). The SCR utilizes a catalyst to increase the NOx removal efficiency, which allows the process to occur at lower temperatures. 
Discussion: LNBs are designed to ""stage"" combustion so that two combustion zones are created, one fuel-rich combustion and one at a lower temperature.  Staging techniques are usually used by LNB to supply excess air to cool the combustion process or to reduce available oxygen in the flame zone.  Staged-air LNB's create a fuel-rich reducing primary combustion zone and a fuel-lean secondary combustion zone.  Staged-fuel LNB's create a lean combustion zone that is relatively cool due to the presence of excess air, which acts as a heat sink to lower combustion temperatures (EPA, 2002).
